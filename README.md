# Project-Description

This repository contains a Python function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

# What is Factorial?
The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

# How it Works
The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. The function uses recursion to calculate the factorial. The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, where the factorial is defined to be 1. If `n` is negative, the function returns an error message indicating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.

# Usage
To use this function, simply run the script and enter a positive integer when prompted. The function will calculate and print the factorial of the input number.
